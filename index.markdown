  Hi, Iâ€™m <a class="link js-link js-link--contact">Victor</a>.

  I am a co-founder at <a class="link js-link" target="_blank" href="http://thenorthstudio.com">North</a>, a digital product studio from Barcelona.

  Being outdoors, authenticity and a mix of creativity and technology turn me on.

  I also enjoy tinkering with <a class="link js-link js-link--projects">new ideas</a> on my free time.
