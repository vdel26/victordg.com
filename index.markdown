  Hi, I’m <a class="link js-link js-link--contact">Victor</a>.

  Co-founder at <a class="link js-link" target="_blank" href="http://thenorthstudio.com">North</a>, a digital product studio from Barcelona.

  I get stuff done and help others do the same. Being outdoors, curiosity, authenticity, and life’s simple pleasures &mdash;like great food&mdash; turn me on.

  Here are <a class="link js-link js-link--projects">some ideas</a> I build for fun on my free time.
projects:
